 <h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>


  The U.S has never been more serious about transitioning to EV on the roadway. Biden's ambitious Infrastructure bill allocates about $7.5 billion nationwide in funding to expand charging station network. At present, California captures 42% of the nationwide EV market with a  total of 425,300 light-duty EV registered 2020 alone according to DMV data. Texas, a state with a large car-centric economy and population, is 3rd in EV adoption nationwide, registering a mere 52,190 EVs in comparison. Yet despite these low numbers, the EV market in Texas is growing fast and will require additional funding to meet future charging needs.  

  In Texas,  reaching 50% of on-road EV would mean building a network of fast-charging stations to meet growing demand. Figuring out the right amount of charging infrastructure to meet EV demand, especially in rural areas where market penetration isn't high, is a top priority for policy makers in Texas seeking to expand EV. Experts reason that faster-charging stations placed in strategic areas across the state would have the effect of inducing more EV demand. However, one of the biggest perceived challenges for consumers considering an EV is "Range Anxiety", a term relating to the fear of being stranded with nowhere to charge while embarking on longer commutes. Building an expansive network of charging stations, particularly in rural counties,  would ease range anxiety and help get millions more EV on the road. A 2018 report from an environmental research nonprofit, Environment Texas,  estimates that the State needs more than 14,000 charging stations to support the number of EV estimated to be on the road by 2030. Although most of the new charging infrastructure will be concentrated in major cities and suburban areas where EV ownership is higher, charging stations in rural areas are important in enabling long distance travel. 


 <h2 align="center"> Why Rural Charging is Important </h2>

 The lack of EV charging infrastructure in rural areas is still a significant barrier to EV adoption. According to EESI, Rural areas cover 97% of the countrys total land area and and are home to a little under 1/4th of the US population yet most charging infrastructure is concentrated in major cities. The most obvious solution to this problem is to focus funding on increasing the density of EV charging outlets in rural areas. Simply imcreasing the number of available charging stations in rural areas would have a major effect on increasing EV demand in rural areas. This positive feedback loop plays an important role in the dynamics of EV ownership and availability. Even with 50-80% of charging occuring at home and 15-20% of commuters charge at work((Hardman et al., 2018), expanding the 10% of all charging events occuring at remaining locations - fast charging along long-distance corridors in cities and rural areas, is crucial to meet the long-range needs of EV owners.

 <h2 align="center"> Analyzing the State of Rural EV Ownership in Texas Methodology </h2>

The goal of this project is to investigate the current state of EV vehicle registration and EV charging in Texas. I produce several maps and time series graphs to analyze trends in EV charging and EV registration counts in rural vs. urban countries. The analysis also provides a general overview of the spatial distribution of charging stations along alternative fuel corridors and in rural vs. urban counties. The maps also helps policy makers assess the charging needs in rural areas.

The map on the left is a map visualization of public EV charging stations data from the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC). The map on the right includes an AFDC map of the national alternative fuel corridors, a national network of plug-in EV charging and other alternative fuel stations along national highway system corridors. The maps highlight the three main clusters of charging stations in Dallas in the far North, Austin to the center left and Houston on the center right. These are the three main cities where EVs are mostly driven and where most charging infrastructure is prioritized. According to the Department of Energy, over 80% of EV charging happens at home and most US car owners only drive an estimated 31 miles a day - a distance that a typical EV can travel several times without needing to recharge. 

 <h2 align="center"> What is the definition of Rural?  </h2> 

The federal government uses two major definitions "rural", one created by the US census Bureau and the other from the Office of Management and Budget.

The Office of Management and Budget define rural areas as areas that don't have central counties with one or more urbanized areas. Urbanized areas are densely-settled urban entities with 50,000 or more people. The definition of urban also includes outlying counties that are economically tied to the core counties as measured by labor-force commuting. Outlying counties are included if 25 percent of workers living in the county commute to the central counties, or if 25 percent of the employment in the county consists of workers coming out from the central countiesâ€”the so-called "reverse" commuting pattern.

The Census definition refers to rural areas as areas comprising open country and settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents. Urban areas comprise larger places and densely settled areas around them. Urban areas do not necessarily follow municipal boundaries. They are essentially densely settled territory as it might appear from the air. Most counties, whether metro or nonmetro, contain a combination of urban and rural populations.

This map, taken from the Texas Department of Health Services shows the spatial distribution of urban (metro) and rural counties in Texas. Travis County, home to the city of Austin and located slightly left of center,  is surrounded by counties designated as metro mostly North and South of Travis county. This in part reflects the fact that in outlying counties, at least 25% of the workers living in these areas commute to the "central" county for work.This designation of metropolitan and rural counties highlights labor-force commuting, which is vital in determining the optimal locations for EV charging stations. Other central counties such as Harris, home to San Antonio, has outlying metro counties on all sides, and from the map of EV charging density, most of the EV stations are clustered in Harris and in the surrounding metro counties. 

<h2 align="center"> EV Registration Snapshots (AFDC Data) </h2>

The following time-series line graphs shows EV registration snapshots at different times from 2019-2021. The snapshots representing the count of EV vehicles "on the road", are not an accurate count of the unique number of EV vehicles registered in the state. Furthermore, this dataset doesn't distinguish between "original" and "renewal" registrations. These multiple snapshots allows policy-makers to piece together changes in the market over time.

</p>

The time series graph above shows the sum of EV Registrations snapshots across all Texas urban counties aggregated by month and year. There are interesting peaks around October 2019, January 2020, and December 2020 and noticable dips such as the sudden drop in April of 2020, which corresponds with the early Corona Virus shelter-in-place mandates.

</p>

The time series graph showing EV registration snapshots in rural counties follows the same trend as EV registration snapshots in urban counties with similar peaks and dips. The biggest difference between the two time-series graphs is the sum of EV registration snapshots at different times. In urban counties, the total EV registration snapshots peak at 30,000 vehicles on the road around December 2020 and gradually decreases to zero whereas in rural counties, the total sum of EV snapshots peaks at 1200 vehicles, which is about 4% the total snapshots in urban counties recorded at that time. The noticable difference in EV registration snapshots reflects the fact that most EV drivers are concentrated in urban areas where population densities are higher and commuting between the surrounding counties and cities is more frequent. The graph highlights the wide disparity in the number of EVs driven in urban vs rural counties. Given that the total number of vehicles driven in rural counties ranges from 200 to 1200, installing more than 1 or 2 stations in some of these counties might not be as optimal considering the average commuting distance of EV drivers and the fact that less than 5% of EV drivers pass through rural counties.

This time series graph shows the total EV registration snapshots across all counties at different snapshot dates. Unlike the other two graphs, the sum of snapshots are not aggregated by month and year but across day, month, and year. The graph highlights the lack of inconsistency with the EV registration snapshots over time. There are some noticable peaks in count of EVs on the road in June 2019, January 2020, May 2020,  and the largest peak in December 2020, where the count of EV snapshots surpassed 10,000 statewide. one reason for the  sudden spikes could be explained by the inconsistency in the snapshot count; There could have been more EVs on the road at locations where the data was being collected or more EVs on the road on a particular holiday. The time series graphs also don't appear to highlight any seasonal trends in EV registration however, in all three time series graphs, there is a steady decline in EV registration snapshots starting in early January of 2021. 

<h2 align="center"> Choropleth Maps </h2> 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77947190/167276978-a200862e-763d-4f99-99f5-c5b4d09b0a52.png" 
   width="800",height = "800"  />
</p> 

The choropleth map shows the geospatial distribution of the sum of EV registration snapshots in 2020. From the choropleth map, we can see that almost all of the EV registration snapshots are concentrated in a handful of urban counties that comprise the major cities in Texas. To the East, Harris County have the highest concentration of EV snapshots at roughly 30,000 . In central Texas, the counties containing the city of Austin and San Antonio also have high EV registration snapshots around 20,000-25,0000,  and to the North, the urban counties containing Forth Worth and Dallas have roughly 20,000 EV registration snapshots counted in 2020. The map also shows the stark contrast in EV registration counts between urban and rural counties. Outside of the main cities and the outlying urban counities, there are almost no EV regisitration snapshots recorded. 

<p align="center">

   width="800",height = "800"  />
</p> 

The choropleth map showing the percentage change in the EV registration snapshots 2020-2021 show large increases in EVs in a handful of rural counties such as in Live Oak, the yellow shaded county which has a resident population of only 12,500. Other rural counties such as Refugio, Zabata, Shelby , and Pancia all had increases in EV registration snapshots over the 2020-2021 period. Largely populated urban counties in contrast had mostly negative or 0 increases in total EV registration snapshots. The increase in EV snapshots in these rural counties might only represent an increase in registrations of 1-8 EVs compared to 0 in the prior year. The positive percentage change in EV registration counts in these rural counties provides some evidence that EV drivers are indeed passing through some of these counties and would benefit from the installation of 1 or 2 EV chargers along these county's main highways.

   width="800",height = "800"  />
</p> 

This choropleth map gives the percentage change in EV registration snapshots counts from 2019-2020. The map shows a similar negative percentage change in most rural and urban counties from 2019 to 2020 with a few rural counties with positive percent changes in EV registration snapshots. The 2019-2020 map highlights the effect of the pandemic lockdown on the total count of EVs on the road which lead to the sigficantly drop in all EVs driven across most counties in 2020. 

 
 <h2 align="center"> Final Map </h2>


![EV_Charging_Station_map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77947190/167279296-862070f2-7fd0-4a2b-96fc-5de6610b1333.png) 

The EV Charging Station Map overlays the total EV registration snapshots by county, EV charging stations, highway networks, and AFDC-designated Alternative Fuel Corridors. The map shows concentration of charging stations and EV registrations in the 4 major metro areas of Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas. We also see EV stations in the urban counties surrounding the major cities and along the alternative fuel corridors connecting the cities. The alternative fuel corridors connecting San Antonio to Austin seems to have the highest number of EV charging stations per square kilometer followed by the alternative fuel corridor connecting Austin to Dallas. There are very few EV charging stations in Western rural Texas and far fewer EV stations connecting Dallas to cities farther North such as Amarillo. 

<h2 align="center"> Summary of Key Findings </h2> 

- EV registration is concentrated in four major counties that include the 4 biggest cities in Texas: Dallas, Austin, Houston, and San Antonio 
- EV Registration Snapshots are also concentrated in the 4 largest counties by population
- There is a significant rural-urban divide in EV charging density and EV registration snapshots as shown from the time-series and choropleth. Less than 5% of all EV Registration snapshots are recorded in rural counties compared urban counties
- EV charging is much more concentrated in counties with large cities and the count of EV registration snapshots are high in counties neighboring large cities ( Austin-San Antonio) 
- EV registration snapshots follow the same time-series trend (peak around Nov-Dec 2020)
- There are many EV Charging Stations along alternative fuel corridors connecting cities such as San Antonio to Austin and Austin to Dallas. However there aren't as many EV charging stations along alternative fuel corridors connecting Dallas to Houston and there is a lack of EV charging stations in most areas of Northern and Western Texas, comprising the majority of rural areas in Texas.  



 <h2 align="center"> Additional Investigations </h2> 
 
In summary, the analysis provided presents a more descriptive approach to the problem of addressing EV charging needs in rural Texas. This doesn't provide clear directions on where to deploy new charging stations but instead, assesses the state of EV adoption and EV charging in both rural and urban areas. A sophisticated network analysis could be performed to address the problem of 'range anxiety' and the lack of EV charging in rural counties. This network analysis would incorporates EV travel data on trip counts, travel times, costs, and distances to create a model that optimizes the placement of new EV Fast Charging Stations across Texas's extensive highway network. Optimality in this model would be defined as maximizing the share or number of long-distance (over 50 - miles, one-way) car trips that EV Drivers already demonstrate. This kind of model would best answer the question of where to deploy new EV charging stations because the model would directly use data on EV driving behavior along major highways to determine EV charging needs.
