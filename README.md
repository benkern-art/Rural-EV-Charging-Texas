### Introduction 

  The U.S has never been more serious about transitioning to EV on the roadway. Biden's ambitious Infrastructure bill allocates about $7.5 billion nationwide in funding to expand charging station networks to meet EV demand. Ar present, California captures 42% of the nationwide EV market with a  total of 425,300 light-duty EV registered 2020 alone according to DMV data. Texas, a state with a large car-centric economy and population, is 3rd in EV adoption nationwide, registering a mere 52,190 EV by the end of June 2021. Yet despite these low numbers, the EV market in Texas is fast growing and will require funding to meet the expected charging needs.  

  In Texas,  reaching 50% of on-road EV will mean mean building a network of fast-charging stations to meet growing demand. Figuring out the right amount of charging infrastructure to meet EV demand, especially in rural areas where market penetration isn't high, is a top priority for policy makers in Texas seeking to expand EV as a climate mitigation solution. Experts reason that faster-charging stations placed in strategic areas across the state would have the effect of inducing more EV demand. However, one of the biggest perceived challenges for consumers considering an EV is "Range Anxiety", a term relating to the fear of being stranded with nowhere to charge while embarking on longer commutes. Building an expansive network of charging stations, particularly in rural counties would ease range anxiety and help get millions more EV on the road. A 2018 report from an environmental research nonprofit Environment Texas estimates that the State needs more than 14,000 charging stations to support the number of EV estimated to be on the road by 2030. Although most of the new charging infrastructure will be concentrated in major cities and suburban areas where EV ownership is higher, charging stationsin rural areas are also being targetted as a way of enabling long-distance travel. 


### Why Rural Charging is Important 

  Many EV owners charge their vehicles overnight in their home using wall-mounted chargers. According to the department of Energy, over 80% of EV charging happens at home nationwide(citation needed). Additionally, most US car owners only drive an estimated 31 miles a day - a distance that a typical EV can travel several times without needing to recharge. Because most EV charging happens in single family homes overnight, many charging incentives focus on lowering the upfront costs of installing fast charging networks through rebates or they focus on incentivizing off-peak charging with utilities offering reduced rates during offpeak hours(footnote). Furthermore, because EV owners don't travel very far, most charging networks have expanded primarily in residential off-street parking spaces - private parking garages and enclosed parking lots, and in urban spaces deemed as Points of Interest ex. grocery stores, gasoline stations, multifamily buildings, alternative fuel corridors. Although the vast majority of charging infrastrucute is concentrated in metro and suburban areas, focusing policy only in these areas doesn't fulfill the needs of all EV owners, especially those who want to travel long commute between cities.

The lack of EV charging infrastructure in rural areas is still a significant barrier to EV adoption. According to EESI, Rural areas cover 97% of the countrys total land area and and are home to a little under 1/4th of the US population yet most charging infrastructure is concentrated in major cities. The most obvious solution to this problem is to focus funding on increasing the density of EV charging outlets in rural areas. Simply imcreasing the number of available charging stations in rural areas would have a major effect on increasing EV demand in rural areas. This positive feedback loop plays an important role in the dynamics of EV ownership and availability. Even with 50-80% of charging occuring at home and 15-20% of commuters charge at work((Hardman et al., 2018), expanding the 10% of all charging events occuring at remaining locations - fast charging along long-distance corridors in cities and rural areas, is crucial to meet the long-range needs of EV owners.
