 <h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>


  The U.S has never been more serious about transitioning to EV on the roadway. Biden's ambitious Infrastructure bill allocates about $7.5 billion nationwide in funding to expand charging station network. At present, California captures 42% of the nationwide EV market with a  total of 425,300 light-duty EV registered 2020 alone according to DMV data. Texas, a state with a large car-centric economy and population, is 3rd in EV adoption nationwide, registering a mere 52,190 EVs in comparison. Yet despite these low numbers, the EV market in Texas is growing fast and will require additional funding to meet future charging needs.  

  In Texas,  reaching 50% of on-road EV will mean mean building a network of fast-charging stations to meet growing demand. Figuring out the right amount of charging infrastructure to meet EV demand, especially in rural areas where market penetration isn't high, is a top priority for policy makers in Texas seeking to expand EV. Experts reason that faster-charging stations placed in strategic areas across the state would have the effect of inducing more EV demand. However, one of the biggest perceived challenges for consumers considering an EV is "Range Anxiety", a term relating to the fear of being stranded with nowhere to charge while embarking on longer commutes. Building an expansive network of charging stations, particularly in rural counties would ease range anxiety and help get millions more EV on the road. A 2018 report from an environmental research nonprofit, Environment Texas,  estimates that the State needs more than 14,000 charging stations to support the number of EV estimated to be on the road by 2030. Although most of the new charging infrastructure will be concentrated in major cities and suburban areas where EV ownership is higher, charging stations in rural areas are important in enabling long distance travel. 


 <h2 align="center"> Why Rural Charging is Important </h2>

 The lack of EV charging infrastructure in rural areas is still a significant barrier to EV adoption. According to EESI, Rural areas cover 97% of the countrys total land area and and are home to a little under 1/4th of the US population yet most charging infrastructure is concentrated in major cities. The most obvious solution to this problem is to focus funding on increasing the density of EV charging outlets in rural areas. Simply imcreasing the number of available charging stations in rural areas would have a major effect on increasing EV demand in rural areas. This positive feedback loop plays an important role in the dynamics of EV ownership and availability. Even with 50-80% of charging occuring at home and 15-20% of commuters charge at work((Hardman et al., 2018), expanding the 10% of all charging events occuring at remaining locations - fast charging along long-distance corridors in cities and rural areas, is crucial to meet the long-range needs of EV owners.

 <h2 align="center"> Analyzing the State of Rural EV Ownership in Texas Methodology </h2>

According to a report by Cobank, the majority of rural areas have EV registration rates of 0-0.5 % which equates to fewer than 5 registered EV's per 10,000 people whereas the rates range from 10-100 per 10,000 people in metro areas. The EESI report finds an average of 10-19 EV registered per 10,10000 people across the whole state of Texas. This number is not informative to policy makers since it doesn't give light to the regional variation in EV charging density and EV registration. The goal of this project is to investigate the current state of EV vehicle registration and EV charging in Texas. I produce several maps and time series graphs to analyze trends in EV charging and EV registration counts in rural vs. urban countries. The analysis also provides a general overview of the spatial distribution of charging stations along alternative fuel corridors and in rural vs. urban counties. The maps also helps policy makers assess the charging needs in rural areas.

The map on the left is a map visualization of public EV charging stations data from the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC). The map on the right includes an AFDC map the national alternative fuel corridors, a national network of plug-in EV charging and other alternative fuel stations along national highway system corridors. The maps highlight the three main clusters of charging stations in Dallas in the far North, Austin to the center left and Houston on the center right. These are the three main cities where EV are mostly driven and where most charging infrastructure is prioritized. According to the Department of Energy, over 80% of EV charging happens at home and most US car owners only drive an estimated 31 miles a day - a distance that a typical EV can travel several times without needing to recharge. 

 <h2 align="center"> What is the definition of Rural?  </h2> 

The federal government uses two major definitions "rural", one created by the US census Bureau and the other from the Office of Management and Budget.

The Office of Management and Budget define rural areas as central counties with one or more urbanized areas. Urbanized areas are densely-settled urban entities with 50,000 or more people. Outlying counties that are economically tied to the core counties as measured by labor-force commuting. Outlying counties are included if 25 percent of workers living in the county commute to the central counties, or if 25 percent of the employment in the county consists of workers coming out from the central counties—the so-called "reverse" commuting pattern.

The Census definition refers to rural areas as areas comprising open country and settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents. Urban areas comprise larger places and densely settled areas around them. Urban areas do not necessarily follow municipal boundaries. They are essentially densely settled territory as it might appear from the air. Most counties, whether metro or nonmetro, contain a combination of urban and rural populations.

This map, taken from the Texas Department of Health Services shows the spatial distribution of metro and rural counties in Texas. Travis County, home to the city of Austin and located slightly left of center,  is surrounded by counties designated as metro mostly North and South of Travis county. This in part reflects the fact that in outlying counties, at least 25% of the workers living in these areas commute to the "central" county for work.This designation of metropolitan and rural counties highlights labor-force commuting, which is vital in determining the optimal locations for EV charging stations. Other central counties such as Harris, home to San Antonio, has outlying metro counties on all sides, and from the map of EV charging density, most of the EV stations are clustered in Harris and in the surrounding metro counties. 

<h2 align="center"> EV Registration Snapshots (AFDC Data) </h2>
the following time-series line graphs shows EV registration snapshots at different times from 2019-2021. The snapshots represent the count of EV vehicles "on the road" are not an accurate count of the unique number of EV vehicles registered in the state. These multiple snapshots allows policy-makers to piece together changes in the market over time.

The time series graph above shows the sum of EV Registrations snapshots across all Texas urban counties aggregated by month and year. There are interesting peaks around October 2019, January 2020, and December 2020 and noticable dips such as the sudden drop in April of 2020, which corresponds with the early Corona Virus shelter-in-place mandates.

The time series graph showing EV registration snapshots in rural counties follows the same trend as EV registration snapshots in urban counties with similar peaks and dips. The biggest difference between the two time-series graphs is the sum of EV registration snapshots at different times. In urban counties, the total EV registration snapshots peak at 30,000 vehicles on the road around December 2020 and gradually decreases to zero whereas in rural counties, the total sum of EV snapshots peaks at 1200 vehicles, which is about 4% the total snapshots in urban counties recorded at that time. The noticable difference in EV registration snapshots reflects the fact that most EV drivers are concentrated in urban areas where population densities are higher and commuting between counties and cities is more frequent. The graph highlights the wide disparity in the number of EVs driven in urban vs rural counties. Given that the total number of vehicles driven in rural counties ranges from 200 to 1200, installing more than 1 or 2 stations in some of these counties might not be as optimal considering the average commuting distance of EV drivers and the fact that less than 5% of EV drivers pass through rural counties. 

However, it is interesting to note that in both graphs, there is a study decline in EV snapshots starting in January 2021 to June 2021.

This time series graph shows the total EV registration snapshots across all counties at different snapshot dates. Unlike the other two graphs, the sum of snapshots are not aggregated by month and year but across day, month, and year.
